## Yahoo Finance Portfolio Analyzer
## A Program in Python

#### The purpose of this program is to show you the annualized gain for all stocks in your portfolio which have been held for a user specified minimum number of years.
#### Stocks picked by the best stock pickers should be held a minimum of 5 years. I have personally found this to be an excellent investment strategy.
#### To use this program, you must first enter your stock data into a Yahoo Finance Portfolio. A v2.0 portfolio is recommended.
