## Yahoo Finance Portfolio Analyzer
## A Program in Python

#### The purpose of this program is to show you the annualized gain for all stocks in your portfolio which have been held for a user specified minimum number of years.
#### Stocks picked by even the best stock pickers should be held a minimum of 5 years. I have personally found this to be an excellent investment strategy.
#### To use this program, you must first enter your stock data into a Yahoo Finance Portfolio. A v2.0 portfolio is recommended. 
#### This is a Windows only program.

   * Navigate to and select your personal "Downloads" folder in the "C:\\Users\\(your-username)" folder.
   

4. Set and save the program's "Minimum Holding Years" field for your analysis.
   * Fill in the field and click the "Save Min Holding Years" button.


5. Perform the three steps on the "Yahoo Finance Analyzer" screen.


6. In step 3, if the results window is blank, try the following:
     * Reduce the "Min Holding Years" to 0 to display the entire portfolio. You may not have held any stock for the "Minimum Holding Years".


7. Once step 2 is completed, you may collect data again using a different number of "Min Holding Years".  
     * In step 3, the data is being collected from the downloaded portfolio.
